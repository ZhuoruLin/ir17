### Syllabus
This graduate level course presents fundamental tools of probabilistic graphical models, with an emphasis on designing and manipulating generative models, and performing inferential tasks when applied to various types of data. 

We will study latent graphical models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Gaussian Processes), state-space models for (Kalman Filter, HMMs), Gibbs Models, Deep generative models (Variational autoencoders, GANs) covering both the methods (inference, sampling algorithms, learning, exponential families) and modeling applications to text, images and physics data.

### Lecture Location
Monday, 6:20-8:00pm, in 60 FA 110
### [Recitation/Laboratory](https://github.com/inf16nyu/home/tree/master/labs) (required for all students)
Wednesdays, 5:20-6:10pm in 60 FA 110

### Office hours
JB: Monday, 10:00-11:00pm. Location: 60 5th ave, 6th floor, room 612.

### Grading
problem sets (45%) + midterm exam (25%) + final project (25%) + participation (5%). 

### Piazza 
We will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/j7ccyig9hwz1ze) to answer questions and post announcements about the course.  Students' use of Piazza, particularly for adequately answering other students' questions, will contribute toward their participation grade.

### Online recordings 
Most of the lectures and labs' videos will be posted to NYU Classes. Note, however, that class attendance is required.

### Bibliography
There is no required book. Assigned readings will come from freely-available online material.

You can read this online for free from [NYU Libraries](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/nyulibrary/detail.action?docID=10597102). We recommend the latest (4th) printing, as earlier editions had many typos. You can tell which printing you have as follows: check the inside cover, below the "Library of Congress" information. If it says "10 9 8 ... 4" you've got the (correct) fourth print.

### Academic Honesty

We expect you to try solving each problem set on your own. However, when being stuck on a problem, we encourage you to collaborate with other students in the class, subject to the following rules:
  - You may discuss a problem with any student in this class, and work together on solving it. This can involve brainstorming and verbally discussing the problem, going together through possible solutions, but should not involve one student telling another a complete solution.
  - Once you solve the homework, you must write up your solutions on your own, without looking at other people's write-ups or giving your write-up to others.
  - In your solution for each problem, you must write down the names of any person with whom you discussed it. This will not affect your grade.
  - Do not consult solution manuals or other people's solutions from similar courses.

#### *Late submission policy*
During the semester you are allowed at most two extensions on the homework assignment. Each extension is for at most 48 hours and carries a penalty of 25% off your assignment.
